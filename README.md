# FuckMETADATA
FuckMETADATA is a simple Python script designed to remove metadata from images.

FuckWebp is a simple script that allows users to delete metadata on images file found inside the same folder as the script. 
This script is designed to be kept in the download folder. Once images are downloaded, execute:

You can easily execute this command by navigating to the download folder (if the script is present) and entering the command in the directory file path, then pressing Enter on the keyboard.
