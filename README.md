# FuckMETADATA
FuckMETADATA is a simple Python script designed to remove metadata from images.

FuckMETADATA is a simple script that allows users to delete metadata on images file found inside the same folder as the script. 
This script is designed to be kept in the download folder. Once images are downloaded, execute:

python FuckMETADATA.py

You can easily execute this command by navigating to the download folder (if the script is present) and entering the command in the directory file path, then pressing Enter on the keyboard.

I made this script for myself, but I think other people could benefit from it.
Here are some of my reasons for not wanting metadata in my image files:

Privacy Concerns: Metadata can contain sensitive information, such as the exact location where a photo was taken, which might compromise your privacy or safety if shared publicly.
File Size: Metadata can slightly increase the size of image files, which might be a concern if you are dealing with a large number of images or limited storage space.
Confidentiality: For professional photographers or businesses, metadata might reveal proprietary information about their techniques, equipment, or workflow.
Metadata Bloat: Over time, as images are edited and saved repeatedly, the metadata can accumulate unnecessary or redundant information, cluttering the file.
Security Risks: In some cases, metadata can be exploited by malicious parties to gather information about you or your activities.
Unnecessary for Casual Use: For casual or personal use, the detailed metadata might not be necessary and can be stripped to simplify file management.
